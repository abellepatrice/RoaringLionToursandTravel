                     <p>Covered end to end in volcanic ash, the nightly glow of its South Island’s luminous vents has inspired
                        numerous tales of ghosts and evil spirits. The island is home to a profusion of birdlife including 34
                        species of European migrants most spectacularly viewed as they return home between March and May. At
                        least 23 species breed here, including Goliath heron, and African skimmer, while African open-billed
                        stork, Duck and Gulls feed on the shores and the volcanic island lakes attract lesser flamingos. Birds
                        of prey are also abundant, especially swallow-tailed kites. This park is ideal for game watching and has
                        one of the world’s largest concentrations of crocodiles.

                <!-- <h3>Serengeti National Park</h3>
                    <p>The Serengeti National Park was established nearly a hundred years ago as a colonial game reserve, made
                        a National Park in 1951, and later endorsed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. Tanzania's oldest
                        and most popular national park was recently proclaimed a 7th world wide wonder.
                        The Serengeti is famed for its annual migration, when some six million hooves pound the open plains, as
                        more than 200,000 zebra and 300,000 Thomson's gazelle join the wildebeest’s trek for fresh grazing. Yet
                        even when the migration is quiet, the Serengeti offers arguably the most scintillating game-viewing in
                        Africa: great herds of buffalo, smaller groups of elephant and giraffe, and thousands upon thousands of
                        eland, topi, kongoni, impala and Grant’s gazelle.
                        The geography of the area ranges from apparently limitless grass plains in the south, fertilized by
                        volcanic ash rich in life-giving phosphates, to wooded highlands in the east, crossed by rivers and
                        studded with island outcrops or kopjes of eroded granite, home to hundreds of vulnerable inhabitants
                        such as the rare black rhinoceros.
                    </p> 
                <h3>Ngorongoro Crater</h3>
                    <p>The Ngorongoro Crater is one of Africa’s most famous sites and is said to have the highest density of
                        wildlife in Africa. Sometimes described as an ‘eighth wonder of the world’, The Ngorongoro Crater is the
                        world’s largest intact volcanic caldera. Forming a spectacular bowl of about 265 square kilometres, with
                        sides up to 600 metres deep; it is home to approximately 30,000 animals at any one time.
                        The Crater rim is over 2,200 metres high and experiences its own climate. From this high vantage point
                        it is possible to make out the tiny shapes of animals making their way around the crater floor far
                        below. Swathes of cloud hang around the rocky rim most days of the year and it’s one of the few places
                        in Tanzania where it can get chilly at night.<br>
                        The crater floor consists of a number of different habitats that include grassland, swamps, forests and
                        Lake Makat (Maasai for ‘salt’) – a central soda lake filled by the Munge River. All these various
                        environments attract wildlife to drink, wallow, graze, hide or climb.
                        You are unlikely to escape other vehicles here, but you are guaranteed great wildlife viewing in a
                        genuinely mind-blowing environment. There is nowhere else in Africa quite like Ngorongoro!
                    </p> 

                <h3>Lake Manyara National Park</h3>
                    <p> This park offers a wilderness experience in diverse habitats, from its Rift Valley soda
                        lake to dense woodlands and steep mountainsides. Apart from a spectacular setting, the park is famous
                        for its unusual tree-climbing lions and the vast elephant herds it was established to protect.
                        The shores of the lake, encrusted with pink flamingo, attract more than 400 species of birds, many of
                        them waterfowl or migrants. Large herds of buffalo, cheetah, Masai giraffe and impala roam the lake
                        shores and the forested valley slopes. <br>
                        A Lake Manyara safari is a fascinating experience, as the park also features a ground-water forest,
                        acacia tortilis woodland and hot springs called Maji Moto. Troops of several hundred olive baboon appear
                        alongside Sykes monkey and short-eared galago. Cape clawless otter, Egyptian mongoose, hippo and
                        klipspringer are other park residents.
                    </p>

                <h3>Tarangire National Park</h3>
                    <p>Tarangire is one of Africa’s little-known gems and a must for any northern circuit itinerary.
                        Boasting a variety of wildlife as diverse as its landscape, Tarangire is also the park that can boast
                        being home to Tanzania’s largest population of African elephants. With four of the Big Five also
                        residing within the park, it is a great spot for a day trip from Arusha or as an addition to a
                        Serengeti/Ngorongoro centred itinerary.
                        Named after Tarangire River which flows through it, the park is an excellent choice during the dry
                        season when animals are forced to move closer and closer to the river in search of water. Set against a
                        backdrop of majestic baobab trees and twisted acacia, it makes for a beautiful experience.
                    </p>
            


                <h3>Akagera National Park</h3>
                    <p>Akagera National park is nestled in the east of the country, bordering Tanzania. The relatively warm and
                        low-lying plains of Akagera comprise savannah, woodland, wetland and a dozen lakes, the largely open
                        expanse is ideal for game viewing. A family of lions from South Africa is settling in well, and breeding
                        successfully, and 18 eastern black rhinos have also been reintroduced. Visitors can also encounter
                        buffalo, elephant, antelope, zebra, giraffe, baboons, monkeys and an incredible 490 bird species. A boat
                        trip on Lake Ihema is also a highlight of any visit to Akagera, with its large pods of hippos, Nile
                        crocodiles and abundant water birds on the island in the middle of the lake. The only way to explore the
                        park is by vehicle.
                    </p>

                <h3>Nyungwe Forest</h3>

                        methane (from the lake bed bacteria).

                <h3>Genocide Museum</h3>
                    <p>No visit to Rwanda would be complete without a visit to the Kigali Genocide Memorial Centre, or
                        ‘Gisozi’. This is where 250,000 victims from the 1994 genocide were buried. The three permanent
                        exhibitions and burial gardens form part of a meaningful tribute to those who perished, and provide a
                        powerful educational tool for visitors. https://www.kgm.rw/

                <h3>Volcanoes National Park</h3>
                    <p>The Volcanoes National Park is situated in the far northwest of Rwanda. Covering an area of 8,000
                        kilometers square, this stunning area protects five of the nine staggeringly beautiful Virunga
                        Mountains, each characterized by steep slopes that are blanketed in thick green, tropical rainforest,
                        bamboo forest, open grassland, swamp and heath. <br>
                        The park is home to five of habituated mountain gorilla families. You will spend between 3-10 hours
                        tracking one of the official gorilla family groups through hillside paths, sometimes crawling through
                        dense vegetation which can at times be difficult. Only 38 visitor permits are available daily, in order
                        to conserve the habitat. This makes early booking essential to avoid disappointment. Tracking the
                        endangered mountain gorillas through the mysterious intimacy of the rain forest, alive with the calls of
                        200 species of colorful birds and chattering of the rare golden monkey, is only one of the truly unique
                        experiences in the area. <br>
                        Within the boundaries of Volcanoes National Park is the Buhanga Eco-Park, an ancient forest holding
                        Rwanda’s most intriguing folklore. The forest is an isolated ritual place where the kings of Rwanda
                        would be initiated and enthroned for kingship. The Musanze Caves, formed 62 million years ago after the
                        last estimated volcanic eruption, is another geological site. These caves go 2km and are covered in the
                        lush greenery. This beautiful vegetation around the caves make for good photography. <br>
                        Other activities in this park include tracking the golden monkeys, climbing one of the volcanic peaks or
                        visiting the grave of Dian Fossey, one of the most iconic primate researchers of our time who was known
                        for her study of the behavior of Rwanda’s majestic mountain gorillas.

                <h3>Queen Elizabeth National Park</h3>
                    <p>This is one of the oldest and largest National Parks in Uganda measuring 3,840km2. It boasts over 76
                        species of mammals and 451 birds. Set against the backdrop of the jagged Rwenzori Mountains, the park’s
                        magnificent vistas include dozens of enormous craters carved dramatically into rolling green hills,
                        panoramic views of the Kazinga Channel with its banks lined with hippos, buffalo and elephants, and the
                        endless Ishasha plains, whose fig trees hide lions ready to pounce on herds of unsuspecting Uganda kob.
                        This park is arguably one of Uganda’s best park with a variety to offer ranging from river cruises along
                        the River Nile to Chimpanzee tracking in the nearby Budongo Forest alongside the game drives within the
                        park on the Savannah grasslands. Wildlife include elephant, lion, Cape buffalo, Rothschild’s giraffe,
                        hartebeest, Oribi, bushbuck, Uganda Kob, Bohor reedbuck, spotted hyena and if lucky you could even spot
                        the leopard amongst others.
                        This park has two distinctive parts i.e. the northern section of the park contains savanna and borassus
                        palms, acacia trees and riverine woodland which is an excellent area for game viewing while the south is
                        dominated by woodland and forest patches extending to the Budongo Forest where Chimps tracking takes
                        place.

                <h3>Murchison falls National Park</h3>
                    <p>Murchison Falls National Park lies at the northern end of the Albertine Rift Valley, where the sweeping
                        Bunyoro escarpment tumbles into vast, palm-dotted savanna. First gazetted as a game reserve in 1926, it
                        is Uganda's largest and oldest conservation area, hosting 76 species of mammals and 451 birds.
                        The park is bisected by the Victoria Nile, which plunges 45m over the remnant rift valley wall, creating
                        the dramatic Murchison Falls, the centerpiece of the park and the final event in an 80km stretch of
                        rapids. The mighty cascade drains the last of the river's energy, transforming it into a broad, placid
                        stream that flows quietly across the rift valley floor into Lake Albert. This stretch of river provides
                        one of Uganda's most remarkable wildlife spectacles. Regular visitors to the riverbanks include
                        elephants, giraffes and buffaloes; while hippos, Nile crocodiles and aquatic birds are permanent
                        residents. <br>
                        The major tourist activities in the park include game viewing typically around the delta circuit,
                        chimpanzee tracking in the Budongo Forest, Launch cruise along the Nile to the bottom of the falls
                        rewards you with sights of a diversity of bird species as well as wildlife, and there is also an
                        interesting walk to the top of the falls.
                        <br>
                        You can either begin or end your day with a river cruise along the mighty Nile that boasts some of the
                        largest crocodiles in the entire continent. The fit ones or “adventurous ones” can combine the river
                        cruises with a 1.5 hrs hike to the top of the falls for better views of the falls. At Murchison Falls,
                        the Nile squeezes through an 8m wide gorge and plunges with a thunderous roar into the "Devil's
                        Cauldron", creating a trademark rainbow.
                    </p> 

                <h3>Bwindi Impenetrable Forest</h3>
                    <p> This can easily be described as Uganda’s most popular park as a Gorilla Trekking base. It is referred to
                        as Impenetrable due to its thick forestation that makes accessibility of the park’s interior difficult.
                        It was declared a UNESCO Natural World Heritage site in 1994 protecting about half of the world’s
                        mountain Gorilla population. It is however quite small in size covering about 321 km². Bwindi boasts 17
                        habituated Gorilla Families split in four bases around the park. Viewing is limited to 8 people per
                        family and for a maximum of 1 hour.
                    </p>  
            
                <h3>Kidepo valley</h3>
                    <p>This is truly one of Uganda’s finest parks enjoying savannah type of climate and boasting a variety of
                        wildlife. Most important is that it is the only park in the Country where you find cheetahs amongst
                        other 77 species of mammals. Due to its distant location about 700 Kms from its capital it is best
                        accessed by flights. During the dry season all rivers dry up leaving remnant pools making this season a
                        prime game viewing period as wildlife gather to quench thirst. There are few tourists who make it here
                        and can agree this is a hidden treasure. The local tribe found here is known as the Karamajong a Nilotic
                        group that has retained most of its culture till today and would be worth a visit.
