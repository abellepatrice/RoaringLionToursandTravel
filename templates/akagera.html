            <h3>Akagera National Park</h3>
                    <p>Akagera National park is nestled in the east of the country, bordering Tanzania. The relatively warm and
                        low-lying plains of Akagera comprise savannah, woodland, wetland and a dozen lakes, the largely open
                        expanse is ideal for game viewing. A family of lions from South Africa is settling in well, and breeding
                        successfully, and 18 eastern black rhinos have also been reintroduced. Visitors can also encounter
                        buffalo, elephant, antelope, zebra, giraffe, baboons, monkeys and an incredible 490 bird species. A boat
                        trip on Lake Ihema is also a highlight of any visit to Akagera, with its large pods of hippos, Nile
                        crocodiles and abundant water birds on the island in the middle of the lake. The only way to explore the
                        park is by vehicle.

            <h3 class="text-center">Best Time to Visit</h3>
            <p>Plan your visit to Akagera National Park wisely:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dry Season (June to September):</strong> The dry season offers excellent wildlife viewing opportunities, as animals congregate around water sources, making them easier to spot. Vegetation is also less dense during this time, providing clearer sightlines for wildlife sightings and photography.</li>
                <li><strong>Wet Season (October to May):</strong> The wet season brings lush green landscapes and newborn wildlife, but wildlife sightings may be more challenging due to thicker vegetation. However, it's an ideal time for birdwatching, as migratory birds flock to the park.</li>
                <li><strong>Shoulder Seasons (June, October, and November):</strong> These transitional months offer a balance between the dry and wet seasons, with fewer tourists and pleasant weather conditions. It's a good time to visit for those seeking quieter experiences.</li>
            </ul>
