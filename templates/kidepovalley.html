                <h3>Kidepo valley</h3>
                    <p>This is truly one of Ugandaâ€™s finest parks enjoying savannah type of climate and boasting a variety of
                        wildlife. Most important is that it is the only park in the Country where you find cheetahs amongst
                        other 77 species of mammals. Due to its distant location about 700 Kms from its capital it is best
                        accessed by flights. During the dry season all rivers dry up leaving remnant pools making this season a
                        prime game viewing period as wildlife gather to quench thirst. There are few tourists who make it here
                        and can agree this is a hidden treasure. The local tribe found here is known as the Karamajong a Nilotic
                        group that has retained most of its culture till today and would be worth a visit.
