                <h3>Murchison falls National Park</h3>
                <p>Murchison Falls National Park lies at the northern end of the Albertine Rift Valley, where the sweeping
                    Bunyoro escarpment tumbles into vast, palm-dotted savanna. First gazetted as a game reserve in 1926, it
                    is Uganda's largest and oldest conservation area, hosting 76 species of mammals and 451 birds.
                    The park is bisected by the Victoria Nile, which plunges 45m over the remnant rift valley wall, creating
                    the dramatic Murchison Falls, the centerpiece of the park and the final event in an 80km stretch of
                    rapids. The mighty cascade drains the last of the river's energy, transforming it into a broad, placid
                    stream that flows quietly across the rift valley floor into Lake Albert. This stretch of river provides
                    one of Uganda's most remarkable wildlife spectacles. Regular visitors to the riverbanks include
                    elephants, giraffes and buffaloes; while hippos, Nile crocodiles and aquatic birds are permanent
                    residents. <br>
                    The major tourist activities in the park include game viewing typically around the delta circuit,
                    chimpanzee tracking in the Budongo Forest, Launch cruise along the Nile to the bottom of the falls
                    rewards you with sights of a diversity of bird species as well as wildlife, and there is also an
                    interesting walk to the top of the falls.
                    <br>
                    You can either begin or end your day with a river cruise along the mighty Nile that boasts some of the
                    largest crocodiles in the entire continent. The fit ones or “adventurous ones” can combine the river
                    cruises with a 1.5 hrs hike to the top of the falls for better views of the falls. At Murchison Falls,
                    the Nile squeezes through an 8m wide gorge and plunges with a thunderous roar into the "Devil's
                    Cauldron", creating a trademark rainbow.
