            <h3>Lake KIVU</h3>
                    <p>This lively and picturesque lake sits on the border between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo,
                        consuming nearly half of the Rwandan border itself. The resort town is a great place for swimming and
                        water sport activities, making it an ideal place to relax after your gorilla trek. Over 31 species of
                        fish have been found in the lake. The deep waters of Lake Kivu, are bursting with vast quantities of
                        three dissolved gases - carbon dioxide & hydrogen sulphide (largely from the volcanic activity) and
                        methane (from the lake bed bacteria).
